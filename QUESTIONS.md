## Technical Questions

Please answer the following questions in a markdown file called `Answers to technical questions.md`.

1. ***How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time?***
I spent approximately 2 days on the coding test. If I had more time, I would consider the following additions to the solution:
Improved error handling and input validation to handle unexpected or invalid inputs gracefully.
Unit tests for edge cases and additional scenarios to ensure the correctness and robustness of the code.
Enhancing the code documentation, adding inline comments, and improving the overall code readability.

2. ***Why did you choose PHP as your main programming language?***
I chose it as my main language for the following reasons:
__Extensive ecosystem:__ PHP has a large and mature ecosystem with a wide range of frameworks, libraries, and tools, making it convenient to build web applications efficiently.
__Community support:__ PHP has a large and active community of developers, providing extensive documentation, tutorials, and resources. This community support makes it easier to find solutions to problems and stay up to date with best practices.
3. ***What is your favourite thing about Laravel? ***
Some notable features of Laravel that I appreciate include:
__Eloquent ORM:__ Laravel's Eloquent ORM provides an elegant and intuitive way to work with databases, allowing developers to define relationships and query data using a fluent and expressive syntax.
__Artisan CLI:__ Laravel's command-line interface, Artisan, provides a set of helpful commands for common development tasks, such as generating boilerplate code, running database migrations, and managing application services.

4. ***What is your least favourite?***
__Performance considerations:__ While Laravel offers excellent developer productivity and ease of use, certain features and abstractions can have an impact on performance. 
__Learning curve for beginners:__ Although Laravel's syntax and conventions are generally beginner-friendly, the framework has a learning curve, especially for developers who are new to PHP or web development. 
5. ***How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?***
__Identify the Performance Issue:__ Monitor the application's performance and identify specific areas or operations that are experiencing slowdowns or performance bottlenecks. In this task, potential performance issues could be related to the calculateShiftMinutes function when multiple breaks are involved.
__Testing and Optimization:__ Create test cases specifically targeting scenarios with multiple breaks and evaluate the performance impact. 
__Code Review:__ Review the code of the calculateShiftMinutes function to identify any potential inefficiencies or areas that could be optimized.
__Load Testing:__ with some tools like Jmeter etc.
